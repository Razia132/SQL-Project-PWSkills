# SQL-Project-PWSkills
Final project of SQL done by me guided by PWSkills Team.
The Superstore dataset, after preprocessing, reveals important business insights by cleaning missing values, correcting data types, and organizing records. The analysis shows the overall sales, profit, and number of unique orders, which provide a clear picture of store performance. By grouping data, we can identify the top-selling products that generate the highest revenue, understand how sales vary across different regions, and see how each product category contributes to both sales and profit. Additionally, analyzing customer segments highlights which groups contribute most to revenue, giving valuable input for marketing strategies. Overall, the processed dataset helps uncover trends, top performers, and customer behavior in a structured and meaningful way.
